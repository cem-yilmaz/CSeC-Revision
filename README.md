# CSeC Revision
 A collection of all of my revision notes for Computer Security.

# Important Notes
- A lot of this was written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and much of the syntax is local to that. You should be able to get the general gist in most cases, but sometimes (e.g images) it won't show up unless in Obsidian

- There are 5 major files which are major write-ups (akin to what Christopher did but I personally think his are better). They've also been exported as PDFs, but Obsidian's PDF exporter isn't perfect.

- There are "flashcard" files for the major topics. These are written in the syntax to work with Obsidian's [Spaced Repetition](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition) plugin.

- You might notice a particular lack of any cryptography stuff, aside from the writeup. This is because I'm banking on not doing a shred of modular arithmetic in the exam, and will be honest about that.

- Sorry if this is written informally, these are notes that work for me and I hope you can gain some benefit from it.

- If there's anything wrong with this repo, either contact me on GitHub or WhatsApp
