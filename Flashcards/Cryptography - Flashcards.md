# Symmetric Cryptography

What are the four types of cryptosystem attacks?
?
[[Cryptography#*Ciphertext-only attack*|Ciphertext-only attack]]
[[Cryptography#*Known-plaintext attack*|Known-plaintext attack]]
[[Cryptography#*Chosen-plaintext attack*|Chosen-plaintext attack]]
[[Cryptography#*Chosen-ciphertext attack*|Chosen-ciphertext attack]]

What is the *unicity distance* of a cryptosystem?::The minimum number of characters of ciphertext that are needed such that there is a single intelligible plaintext associated with it.

## One-Time-Pads
Where do [[Cryptography#One-Time Pads|One-Time Pads]] get their *one-time* namesake from?::If these pads are reused more than once, this allows for statistical analysis

One-Time Pads are similar to a a *Vign√®re cipher* but the difference is that all the ==keys== are ==randomised==
